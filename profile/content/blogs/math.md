## HUGO

Getting started with my Hugo site was a bit of a journey. 

At first, I had no idea where to begin, but I was determined to figure it out. I faced many difficulties along the way, from understanding the basics of Hugo to grappling with the complexities of web development. 

There were moments when I felt frustrated and overwhelmed, but I kept pushing forward. With patience and perseverance, I slowly started to piece things together. 

Actually i completed my site using the theme(personal-web) where the theme is not getting constructed perfectly and and i had to change my theme in order to that.
 
And Here I am with my Website using Hugo.
